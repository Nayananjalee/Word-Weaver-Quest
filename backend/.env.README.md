# 🔒 Security Notice

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This file contains sensitive API keys and should NEVER be committed to Git!

The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` to protect your credentials.

## What's in this file:
- Google API Key (for Gemini AI)
- Supabase URL and API Key (for database)

## For deployment:
- Use environment variables in hosting platforms (Render, Vercel)
- Never hardcode these values in your code
- Create new `.env` files for different environments (dev, staging, prod)

## If compromised:
1. Regenerate API keys immediately
2. Update keys in deployment platforms
3. Check for unauthorized usage

## Best practices:
- Use `.env.example` (without real values) for sharing project setup
- Keep `.env` local only
- Rotate keys periodically
